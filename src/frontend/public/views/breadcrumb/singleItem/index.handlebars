This is a sample of a simple breadcrumb path. 
As far as there is only a single item, click on the left arrow will navigate backwards

<pre>
<code>
{
    "title": "Views.Breadcrumb.SingleItem.Title",
    "breadcrumb": [
        { "title": "GeneralTexts.Previous.Page", "url": "/" }
    ]
}
</code>
</pre>
